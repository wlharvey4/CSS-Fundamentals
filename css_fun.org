Can you center an HTML element? Do you know how the box model works?
CSS is a fundamental language imperative to working with websites. It
controls all the visual aspects of a site, from colors to layouts.

Even the most experienced developer can learn something new when it
comes to using and understanding how the browser interprets CSS. In
this course, we will slowly style a website according to a mocked
image. Let’s walk through:
- specificity
- fonts
- the box model
- margins
- padding
- positioning
- and much more!

* Set CSS Properties and Values---Syntax
#+CINDEX:syntax
The CSS syntax writes somewhat similar to JavaScript objects. It is
important to understand where to properly set *properties*,
*selectors*, and *values* within your CSS.  /In this lesson we’ll talk
about this syntax and work an example./

** CSS Components
Instructor: 00:00 CSS is a language that controls how documents are
presented on the Web to users. This means it controls how text,
images, and other elements lay out on a page, how they respond to
different devices, and so much more.

#+CINDEX:components, 2 main
00:14 We can write a quick example of CSS by styling some specific
content to appear as the color =red= on the page.

CSS has two main {{{dfn(components)}}}.

1. Selector and corresponding block
2. Declaration: property and corresponding value; must end with a
   semicolon.

#+caption[CSS Components]:CSS Component: Selector, Declaration Block, Declaration (property-value)
#+name:css-components
#+begin_src css
  h1 {			(ref:selector-block)
      color: red;		(ref:property-value)
  }
#+end_src

{{{heading(Selector and Declaration Block)}}}

#+CINDEX:selector, component
#+CINDEX:block, component
#+CINDEX:block, declaration
First, the selector and its corresponding block.  This first statement
({{{samp(h1)}}}) is called a {{{dfn([[(selector-block)][selector]])}}}.  This is how we tell
the browser which elements of HTML we want to apply the defined styles
to.

#+CINDEX:declaration block, CSS
#+CINDEX:CSS declaration block
00:35 Everything defined inside of these curly braces will apply to
this selector only. These are also called {{{dfn([[(selector-block)][CSS declaration
blocks]])}}}.  Inside of these blocks are the {{{dfn([[(property-value)][CSS
declarations]])}}}.

{{{heading(Declarations---Properties and Values)}}}

#+CINDEX:property, component
00:48 On the left-hand side of the colon, these are called [[(property-value)][properties]].
{{{dfn(Properties)}}} are the feature of the page we want to style.
In our case, we want to change the color feature of our ~h1~ selector
to be the color =red=.

01:01 On the right side of our colon, these are called
{{{dfn(values)}}}.  Each property has a specific set of valid values
that can be chosen to implement on a website.  This is the how we want
to change the defined feature.

01:15 We end each CSS declaration with a semicolon.  This is required,
or the browser will not render the style correctly.

* Use Selectors to Style HTML Elements
CSS gives us the ability to work with many different types of
selectors to target and style HTML.  In this lesson we will understand
how to use classes, ids, elements, attributes, and the universal
selector.

** Targeting Elements Using Selectors
#+CINDEX:target html elements
Instructor: 00:00 There are many different ways you can target HTML to
style.  Here in the browser, I'm running some basic unstyled HTML,
which is also shown here.

#+caption:{{{code(home.html)}}} Unstyled Code
#+name:unstyled-home.html
#+begin_src html -n :noweb no-export
<<home.html>>
#+end_src

#+begin_comment
NOTE: If the following long code source listing is given a 'caption',
it will be wrapped in a '@float', and will appear on one page only,
truncated at the last line on that page.  By placing the above code
with a 'noweb' reference to the long code listing, a caption can be
generated and placed into the Listings section at the end of the
document, and all of the code will appear on multiple pages.  This is
because only @float's can be placed in lists.
#+end_comment

#+name:home.html
#+begin_src html -n

{{{heading(Use CSS Selectors to Target Elements)}}}

Let's use CSS to target and style this ~h1~ tag that holds my name.

{{{subheading(Type Selector)}}}

#+CINDEX:type selector
00:17 The first way we can target and style the ~h1~ is by using a
[[(type-selector)][*type selector*]].  {{{dfn(Type selectors)}}} match the provided node.
All ~h1~ elements within the scope of this CSS will have a blue color.

#+begin_src css
h1 {			(ref:type-selector)
 color: blue;
}
#+end_src

{{{subheading(universal selector)}}}

#+CINDEX:universal selector
00:31 We could affect not only this one ~h1~, but every element by
using the {{{dfn(universal selector)}}}, =*=.  This accomplishes our
goal, but it's not very efficient, because the browser will have to
apply it to many nodes.

#+begin_src css
,* {
 color: blue;
}

#+end_src

00:43 Instead, let's go ahead and add a =class= attribute to our ~h1~,
and we'll give it a string of {{{samp(name)}}}.

#+begin_src html
<h5>Hello,I am</h5>
<h1 class='name'>Tyler Clark</h1>		(ref:class-attribute)
<p>UX Designer / Fronted Developer</p>
#+end_src

{{{subheading(Class Selector)}}}

#+CINDEX:class selector
Instead of our styles, we'll change this universal selector to =.name=
and refresh.  As you can see, now we're only targeting our one ~h1~.

This is the third type of selector, the {{{dfn([[(class-selector)][class selector]])}}}.
This will match in style and every element that has the [[(class-attribute)][=class=]]
attribute of =name=.

#+begin_src css
.name {				(ref:class-selector)
 color: blue;
}
#+end_src

{{{subheading(Id Selector)}}}

#+CINDEX:id selector
01:08 When we are targeting classes, we use the dot in front of the
providing class name.  There is also the {{{dfn([[(id-selector)][=id= selector]])}}},
which is also an attribute called [[(id-element)][=id= on the HTML element]].

#+begin_src html
<div>
  <h5>Hello, I am</h5>
  <h1 id='name'>Tyler Clark</h1>		(ref:id-element)
#+end_src

However, we don't target IDs with the dot, but with the =#=.  Our
element is still blue.

#+begin_src css
#name {				(ref:id-selector)
 color: blue;
}
#+end_src

{{{subheading(Attribute Selector)}}}

#+CINDEX:attribute selector
Let's go ahead and remove this =id= attribute and replace it with
~data-name="name"~.

#+begin_src html
<div>
  <h5>Hello, I am</h5>
  <h1 data-name="name">Tyler Clark</h1>
  <p>UX Designer / Fronted Developer</p>
#+end_src

01:36 Instead of our CSS, we'll do ~[data-name]="name"~.  If we save
this and refresh, we'll see that we're still blue.

#+begin_src css
[data-name='name'] {		(ref:attribute-selector)
 color: blue;
}
#+end_src

While there are specific methods for targeting =class= and =id=
element attributes, other attributes provided to HTML elements can be
targeted as well by copying the attribute and placing it within square
brackets. This is called using the {{{dfn([[(attribute-selector)][attribute selector]])}}}.

* Utilize Selector Specificity to Control Applied Styles
#+CINDEX:specificity, core concept
When selectors conflict, the browser needs to know which property /
value combination to paint.  *Specificity* is one of the core concepts
of CSS and is important to understand in order to implement
deterministic styles.  Let's look at the specificity rules and learn
the power of each selector.

** Specificity Rules
 00:00 We can target all of our navigation ~li~'s by simply doing ~li
 color blue~.  As you can see when we refresh, we get them to all be
 blue.

 #+begin_src css
   li {
    color: blue;
   }
 #+end_src

{{{heading(Handling Conflicts)}}}

 #+CINDEX:conflict, styles
We can add a conflicting style to one ~li~, the home ~li~, by giving it a
class of =home=.

#+begin_src html
<div>
  <ul>
    <li class='home'>
#+end_src

Now we can target that class by ~.home~ and give it the =color: red=.
Now when we save and refresh our home ~li~ is now red while all the rest
of them are blue.

#+begin_src css
/*
element = 0,0,1
classes = 0,1,0
*/

li {
 color: blue;
}
.home {
 color: red;
}
#+end_src

{{{heading(Resolving Multiple Selectors Targeting Same Element)}}}

#+CINDEX:cascade
#+CINDEX:specificity values
#+CINDEX:specificity, element selectors
#+CINDEX:specificity, class selectors
00:25 When multiple selectors are targeting the same element, the
browser needs to know which one to apply.  This is where the cascade
and specificity come into play.

{{{subheading(Class Selectors Beat Element Selectors)}}}

#+CINDEX:element selectors
#+CINDEX:class selectors
*Element selectors* have a specificity value of =0,0,1=, while
*classes* have =0,1,0=.  Because the classes value is larger than the
element, the =home= class is going to overrule the ~li~.  That's why
it's red.

{{{subheading(Id Selectors Beat Class and Element Selectors)}}}

#+CINDEX:id selectors
00:51 Now let's give our home ~li~ an id of =home=.

#+begin_src html
<div>
  <ul>
    <li class='home' id='home'>
#+end_src

We'll target that by =#home=, give it a color of =gray=.  Save and
refresh and we see that now our red goes to gray.

#+begin_src css
/*
element = 0,0,1
classes = 0,1,0
ids = 1,0,0
*/

li {
 color: blue;
}
.home {
 color: red;
}
#home {
 color: gray;
}
#+end_src

#+CINDEX:specificity value, id
#+CINDEX:id specificity value
This is because *id*'s have an even higher specificity of element and
classes of =1,0,0=.  This is going to overrule the other two.

01:13 Even if we added more targeted element selectors to the color
red, for example, ~div ul li~, the id still wins.  This is because the
id of =1,0,0= is larger than an element with three elements.  As you
can see, =0,0,3= is still smaller.

01:32 Even when we combine elements with classes to target our ~li~,
when we save and refresh, the id still wins.  This would be like having
a =0,1,3=, which is still smaller than the =1,0,0= of the id.

#+begin_src css
div ul li {
 color: blue;
}
.home {
 color: red;
}
#home {
 color: gray;
#+end_src

{{{subheading(Inline Styles Beat Ids, Classes, Elements)}}}

01:47 It's also good to know that *inline style*'s will beat out id's,
classes, and elements.  Give it a color of purple and refresh. This
makes our home ~li~ purple.

#+begin_src html
<ul>
  <li class='home' id='home' style='color: purple'>
    <a>Home</a>
#+end_src

#+CINDEX:@code{!important} tag
Then something that even beats inline styles is using the
*=!important=* tag.  If we go back and put it onto our element
selector and refresh, we're back to blue.  That's because an
=!important= rules all in this case.

#+begin_src css
div ul li {
 color: blue !important;
}
.home {
 color: red;
}
#home {
 color: gray;
#+end_src

* Style Elements Using the Cascade
CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets.  It can be frustrating when
working with CSS and elements are not styling correctly because there is a
conflicting style lower on the cascade.  Let's look at how the browser uses the
cascade to determine which styles to implement.

** Source Order Matters
00:00 Let's go ahead and style all of our =li=s to be the color =red=.  We'll
do that by doing ~li color red~.  Save and refresh.  Everything's red.

#+begin_src css
li {
 color: red;
}
#+end_src

Great.  Let's copy this and do the same thing, =li=, but give it a =color:
blue= and save.  We'll see that everything turns to blue even though we still
have the =color: red= above it.

#+begin_src css
li {
  color: red;
}

li {
  color: blue;
}
#+end_src

#+CINDEX:Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
#+CINDEX:source order
00:22 CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets, which points to the fact
that source order, or how we define our styles, actually affects what gets
displayed in the browser.  *When styles conflict like this, the browser will
look at specificity, then to the source order that we define our styles.*

00:40 *Since these two =li=s are the same specificity, the lower =li= color
value is applied, as we see.*  This is true for any type of selector.  Let's
give one =li= a class of =home=.

#+begin_src html
<ul>
  <li class='home'>
#+end_src

Now we'll change this top =li= to a color of =red=, which will change the one
to red.

00:57 Then, if we add this second one of color blue, we'll see that blue still
wins.  It doesn't matter what selector you use.  *The bottom of the cascade
will always win.*

#+begin_src css
.home {
  color: red;
}

.home {
  color: blue;
}
#+end_src

01:07 Let's go ahead and add another class to our =li=.  We'll say =home--two=.
We'll change this second class to =home--two=.  Save and refresh.  You can see
that it still stays blue.  It doesn't matter how many classes we have on this
=li=.  *When two selectors collide, it's going to take whatever class is
lower.*

#+begin_src html
<ul>
  <li class='home home--two'>
#+end_src

#+begin_src css
.home {
  color: red;
}

.home--two {
  color: blue;
}
#+end_src

01:27 Even we switch up the order -- we do =home--two= and then =home= -- we
see that blue still wins because =home--two= lives lower on the cascade.  *It
doesn't matter the order of the classes here.  What matters is the source
order.*

#+begin_src html
<ul>
  <li class='home-two home'>
#+end_src
